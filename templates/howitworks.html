        <h1>Bird Watch: How it Works</h1>
        <p class="lead">Bird Watch is a deep learning computer vision application, developed using Keras and TensorFlow, with Flask for the web application. The InceptionV3 deep learning model was used as the base model and was trained using transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques.</p>
        <p class="lead">The images are processed in 400x400 pixel resolution. The model was trained for 100 iterations on bottleneck features and then fine-tuned for a further 100 iterations.</p>
        <p class="lead">The full model is shown below:</p>
